# Welcome to the CCSS Digital Library. This instructional technology research project is simply investigating new ways to provide reference materials for educators. ***This project is not affliated with any federal, state, or local agencies.***

### Deliverables

Two repos contain the Math and ELA Standards in many formats:
  + [https://github.com/dofufa/ccssmath][math]
  + [https://github.com/dofufa/ccssela][ela]

With that source data, we are able to generate new instructional resources.

For example, we can create a podcast-like audiobook that reads all 664 math items.

  + [https://mpod.ccss.app/][mpod]

These audio files are also accessible through QR codes on [loose leaf notebook paper][notebook] in PDF format. These PDF documenets are both printable (to local or cloud printers) and markable (with Apple pencil on iPad tablets).
